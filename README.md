# canvas-lms: group members csv upload

This is a plugin for Canvas LMS to add/edit group members with a CSV file. 

Displays two options in the Groups tool: Add students / Edit groups. 
When clicking on any of the two options, shows a dialog where the user can select a csv file.
The plugin reads the file and modifies the group members accordingly.
When using the option to edit group members, the members that are not included in the file are removed from the group.

Note: The plugin is at the moment quite customized, but that may change in the future. Test it in your own Canvas instance and adjust it to your own needs.
